I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at Colorado State University and will be on the job market during the 2026–2027 year. 

I am an applied microeconomist specializing in energy, environmental, and agricultural issues. My research uses empirical industrial organization and causal inference methods to study how consumers, firms, and producers respond to economic incentives and policy interventions. I received my M.S. from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.
